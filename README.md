# Hi, I'm Daniel 👋

> "We should not be in the business of building security features, but rather we should be in the business of designing features securely." 💭

I’m a passionate student and aspiring cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in digital forensics, computer security, and cloud technologies. Currently, I serve as a Teaching Assistant for a course in this field, where I enjoy supporting students, solving challenging problems, and deepening my own understanding of cybersecurity concepts. 🔐

I’m particularly interested in incident response, forensic analysis, ethical hacking, and cloud security, and I love exploring ways technology can both protect and challenge our digital world. ☁️🕵

I’m always looking to learn from peers, contribute to projects, and connect with professionals in the cybersecurity, forensics, and cloud security communities. 🌐
